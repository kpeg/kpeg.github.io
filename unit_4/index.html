<p id="slogan">Turn photobombs into bomb photos.</p>


<p>The name KPEG comes from my love of photographs or JPEGs. I like to take pictures, Photoshop them, frame them, share them with friends and create art with them. Friends and family are always sending photos that they know have potential, asking me to “do my thing to it” so they can transform it into art. I’d like to help you do the same through affordable photo airbrushing services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color correction</li>
<li>Remove Blemishes</li>
<li>Remove/Change Background</li>
<li>Merge Photos</li>
</ul>
